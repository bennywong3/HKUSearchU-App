# HKUSearchU
This is a backup of the group project that I worked on. We created a mobile app called HKUSearchU using **React Native**.
## Project description
Have you ever lost any items in HKU? Or found any lost items but didnâ€™t know what to do? HKUSearchU helps HKUers to search and report lost items. You can view all found lost items in a list or a map. Each record contains the item type and description, found time and location, retrieving method and an image. If you found something, use the app to fill in a simple form so other users can view the record.
